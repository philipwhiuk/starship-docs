## Texas

State in which both McGregor test facility and Boca Chica construction & launch sites are located.

### Constitution

In 2009, an amendment was passed that protects beach access by the public: 
> "individually and collectively, has an unrestricted right to use and a right of ingress to and egress from a public beach.” Tex. Const. art. I, §33(b)

### Legislature

### 83rd Texas House Session Bill - House Bill (H.B) 2623

**Filing**: https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/83R/billtext/html/HB02623F.HTM

**Amending**: Texas Open Beaches Act

**Purpose**: Allows Cameron County officials to close beach access for spaceflight purposes

**Status** In Force

### State District Courts

#### 445th District Court, District Clerk, Cameron County, Texas

##### Save RGV vs Texas General Land Office and Cameron County

**Summary**

In 2009, the Texas Constitution was amended to protect the public's access to the beach. In 2013 (ahead of SpaceX's arrival) Texas passed a bill amending the Open Beaches Act, allowing for beach closures for spaceflight activities.

SaveRGV, a nonprofit environmental organization, filed a lawsuit in State District Court alleging that closing Boca Chica Beach for SpaceX tests and launches violates the Texas Open Beaches Act.

The fundamental questions are:

* Is the beach being closed beyond the judge's orders
* Do the beach closures being ordered fall within the act
* Is the Act itself constitutional given the 2009 amendment

The lawsuit primarily challenges the status quo based on the final point.

**Type** Civil

**Docket** Case 2021-DCL-05887 08215

**Parties** SaveRGV vs. Texas General Land Office,George P. Bush, Cameron County

**Initial Filing** 11/10/2021

## NASA

Currently engaged in process for selecting Moon-landing system. May also seek to use Starship for future deep space missions.

https://sam.gov/opp/6660d1e719fb47f6b1b5013e3ae56fac/view?index=opp

* **Status**: Decided
* **Outcome**: NASA selected Astra over RocketLab's Electron and Starship

>  A weakness was assigned because SpaceX’s FPR did not clearly
demonstrate progress toward the resolution of the environmental assessment which results in risk
associated with obtaining an FAA launch license, increasing the likelihood of delays that would
affect contract performance. 

> SpaceX’s FPR included the same integrated master schedule that was
included in the initial proposal and does not indicate that any milestones scheduled for
completion have been completed. As a result, there is significant risk in the proposed launch
approach based on the required launch date and the current status of the proposed launch vehicle
that increases the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

> Astra had the lowest proposed price at $7.95M. SpaceX had the next lowest proposed price and they were somewhat higher than Astra.

### Space Technology Announcement of Collaboration Opportunity (ACO)

> SpaceX will partner with NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, to capture imagery and thermal measurements of its Starship vehicle during orbital re-entry over the Pacific Ocean. With the data, the company plans to advance a reusable thermal protection system, which protects the vehicle from aerodynamic heating, for missions returning from low-Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars.

GAO issued statement, denying appeals by both Blue Origin & Dynetics: 
https://www.gao.gov/press-release/statement-blue-origin-dynetics-decision

> In denying the protests, GAO first concluded that NASA did not violate procurement law or regulation when it decided to make only one award.  NASA’s announcement provided that the number of awards the agency would make was subject to the amount of funding available for the program.  In addition, the announcement reserved the right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no award at all.  In reaching its award decision, NASA concluded that it only had sufficient funding for one contract award.  GAO further concluded there was no requirement for NASA to engage in discussions, amend, or cancel the announcement as a result of the amount of funding available for the program.  As a result, GAO denied the protest arguments that NASA acted improperly in making a single award to SpaceX.   

> GAO next concluded that the evaluation of all three proposals was reasonable, and consistent with applicable procurement law, regulation, and the announcement’s terms.  

> Finally, GAO agreed with the protesters that in one limited instance NASA waived a requirement of the announcement for SpaceX.  Despite this finding, the decision also concludes that the protesters could not establish any reasonable possibility of competitive prejudice arising from this limited discrepancy in the evaluation.

## FERC

"The FERC is responsible for authorizing the siting and construction of onshore and near-shore LNG import or export facilities under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act."

SpaceX isn't really an importer or exporter of LNG so this would not seem to apply.

## PHMSA 

PHMSA's remit is governed by "49 CFR Part 193" which excludes:

> LNG facilities used by ultimate consumers of LNG or natural gas.

Given the VLA is a consumer facility this would seem not to apply. But it may cover the gas well lot.
