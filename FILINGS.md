# Starship Filings

Paperwork related to Starship operations (especially with a focus on approvals processes).

# Multi-Agency

## Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
This document under-pins the operation of the Boca Chica facility. It is on this basis that SpaceX is able to operate, obtain hours of road closure and so on.

### Parties

* **Status**: Decided
* **Outcome**: NASA selected Astra over RocketLab's Electron and Starship

>  A weakness was assigned because SpaceX’s FPR did not clearly
demonstrate progress toward the resolution of the environmental assessment which results in risk
associated with obtaining an FAA launch license, increasing the likelihood of delays that would
affect contract performance. 

> SpaceX’s FPR included the same integrated master schedule that was
included in the initial proposal and does not indicate that any milestones scheduled for
completion have been completed. As a result, there is significant risk in the proposed launch
approach based on the required launch date and the current status of the proposed launch vehicle
that increases the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

> Astra had the lowest proposed price at $7.95M. SpaceX had the next lowest proposed price and they were somewhat higher than Astra.

### Space Technology Announcement of Collaboration Opportunity (ACO)

> SpaceX will partner with NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, to capture imagery and thermal measurements of its Starship vehicle during orbital re-entry over the Pacific Ocean. With the data, the company plans to advance a reusable thermal protection system, which protects the vehicle from aerodynamic heating, for missions returning from low-Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars.

## GAO (Government Accountability Office)

Responsible for ensuring other federal agencies (e.g. NASA) follow fair selection process.

### NNH19ZCQ001K - Human Landing System Contract

* Blue Origin Federation, LLC - File Number: B-419783.3 - https://www.gao.gov/docket/b-419783.3
* Dynetics, Inc- a Leidos Company - File Number: B-419783.4 - https://www.gao.gov/docket/b-419783.4

GAO issued statement, denying appeals by both Blue Origin & Dynetics: 
https://www.gao.gov/press-release/statement-blue-origin-dynetics-decision

> In denying the protests, GAO first concluded that NASA did not violate procurement law or regulation when it decided to make only one award.  NASA’s announcement provided that the number of awards the agency would make was subject to the amount of funding available for the program.  In addition, the announcement reserved the right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no award at all.  In reaching its award decision, NASA concluded that it only had sufficient funding for one contract award.  GAO further concluded there was no requirement for NASA to engage in discussions, amend, or cancel the announcement as a result of the amount of funding available for the program.  As a result, GAO denied the protest arguments that NASA acted improperly in making a single award to SpaceX.   

> GAO next concluded that the evaluation of all three proposals was reasonable, and consistent with applicable procurement law, regulation, and the announcement’s terms.  

> Finally, GAO agreed with the protesters that in one limited instance NASA waived a requirement of the announcement for SpaceX.  Despite this finding, the decision also concludes that the protesters could not establish any reasonable possibility of competitive prejudice arising from this limited discrepancy in the evaluation.


## FAA

Dominant licensing and authorisation body for spaceflight. Must allow spaceports, launch and landing attempts.

### Spaceport License

None (which is kinda odd)
