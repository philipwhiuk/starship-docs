* **Status**: Decided
* **Outcome**: NASA selected Astra over RocketLab's Electron and Starship

>  A weakness was assigned because SpaceX’s FPR did not clearly
demonstrate progress toward the resolution of the environmental assessment which results in risk
associated with obtaining an FAA launch license, increasing the likelihood of delays that would
affect contract performance. 

> SpaceX’s FPR included the same integrated master schedule that was
included in the initial proposal and does not indicate that any milestones scheduled for
completion have been completed. As a result, there is significant risk in the proposed launch
approach based on the required launch date and the current status of the proposed launch vehicle
that increases the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

> Astra had the lowest proposed price at $7.95M. SpaceX had the next lowest proposed price and they were somewhat higher than Astra.
